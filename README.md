# Summarisation
This repo contains experiments on summarization on legal text.

### A brief description of scripts
* DataCleaner.py - Extracts the ```<judgement>``` content out of all documents in pwd and stores them in a new directory called judgements
* Summarizery.py - Runs lex rank in all documents in pwd. It is recommended to use it on clean documents.
